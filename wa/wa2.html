<p>hello my name is arden villanueva, my pronouns are she/her! my goals for this short semester in this class are to learn more about web 
    design and the coding / background for it. i am excited to lean more languages of code and get better at coding overall as this course goes on.
    i am from san antonio, texas! the heat of the summer is truly horible there, i am very glad to be here in boulder this summer although i do miss my family so much.
    i love to watch rupaul, this is what i have on the tv at all times pretty much. i have seen every season and some even up to 4 times. i love the art of drag.
    i just took up the hobby of doing my own nails! i have gotten my nails done pretty much every month from 7th grade till my senior year of high school. i finally 
    decided to do them on my own and not spend so much money when i can do them myself! its super fun and theraputic to do them actually so i am glad i decided to do so. 
    my boyfriend and i like gaming and we do this together everyday. we like to play fortnite and minecraft, we have our own little world in minecraft it is so fun!
