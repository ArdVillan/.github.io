                <p>
                    RuPaul Andre Charles[1][2] (born November 17, 1960) is an American drag queen, television personality, actor, singer, producer, and writer. He[a] produces, hosts, and judges the reality 
                    competition series RuPaul's Drag Race and has received several accolades, including 14 Primetime Emmy Awards, three GLAAD Media Awards, a Critics' Choice Television Award, two Billboard Music Awards, 
                    and a Tony Award. He has been dubbed the "Queen of Drag" and is considered the most commercially successful drag queen in the United States, with Fortune saying that he is "easily the world's most famous drag 
                    queen."[5] in 2017, RuPaul was included in the annual Time 100 list of the most influential people in the world.[6][7]<br>
                    <br>
                    Born and raised in San Diego, RuPaul later studied performing arts in Atlanta, before relocating to New York City, where he became a popular fixture on the LGBT nightclub scene. He achieved 
                    international fame as a drag queen with the release of his debut single, "Supermodel (You Better Work)", which was included on his debut studio album Supermodel of the World (1993). RuPaul became a 
                    spokesperson for MAC Cosmetics in 1994, raising money for the Mac AIDS Fund and becoming the first drag queen to land a major cosmetics campaign. He later received his own television talk show on VH1 titled 
                    The RuPaul Show (1996–1998), while co-hosting the morning radio show on WKTU with Michelle Visage.<br>
                    <br>
                    RuPaul's Drag Race was created in 2009 and has gone on to produce sixteen seasons in the United States. The show has also seen success internationally. There are several international variants of the show, 
                    including RuPaul's Drag Race UK (2019–present) and Canada's Drag Race (2020–present). This has also inspired several spin-offs of the main show, including RuPaul's Drag U (2010–2012), RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars, 
                    (2012–present), and RuPaul's Secret Celebrity Drag Race (2020–2022). He has also featured as a host on other reality series, such as Skin Wars (2014–2016), Good Work (2015), and Gay for Play Game Show Starring RuPaul (2016–2017).<br>

                <h2>Early Life</h2>
                <p>
                    RuPaul was born in San Diego on November 17, 1960, the son of Ernestine "Toni" (née Fontenette) and Irving Andrew Charles. His parents were both from Louisiana.[9][10] He was named by his mother; "Ru" came from roux, 
                    the French term for the base of gumbo and other creole stews and soups.[11] According to DNA analysis by Finding Your Roots staff, his ancestry is 70% African and 30% European.[10][12]<br>
                    <br>
                    In the early 1990s, RuPaul worked the Georgia club scene and was known by his full birth name. Initially participating in gender bender-style performances, he performed solo and in collaboration with other bands at
                     several New York City nightclubs, most notably the Pyramid Club. He played opposite New York City drag performer Mona Foot (Nashom Benjamin) in the one-act science-fiction parody "My Pet Homo", written and directed by Jon Michael Johnson for Cooper Square Productions. 
                     He performed for many years at the annual Wigstock drag festival and appeared in the documentary Wigstock: The Movie.<br>

                    In 2004, RuPaul released his fourth album, Red Hot on his own RuCo Inc. music label. It received dance radio and club play, but very little press coverage. On his blog he discussed how he felt betrayed by the entertainment industry, 
                    particularly the gay press. In one incident, it was noted that Entertainment Weekly refused to review the album, instead asking him to make a comedic contribution to a fashion article. He likened the experience to "a black person being invited to a party, 
                    but only if they'll serve." Despite his apparent dissatisfaction with the release, Red Hot's lead single "Looking Good, Feeling Gorgeous" peaked at number two on the dance chart. The second, "WorkOut", peaked at number five. The third and final single from 
                    the album "People Are People" a duet with Tom Trujillo, peaked at number 10. The album itself only charted on the Top Electronic Albums chart, where it hit number nine.[25] RuPaul later noted, "Well, betrayed might be the wrong word. 'Betrayed' alludes to an idea 
                    that there was some kind of a promise made to me, and there never was. More so, I was disappointed. I don't feel like it was a betrayal. Nobody promises anything in show business and you understand that from day one. But, I don't know what happened. It seemed I couldn't get 
                    press on my album unless I was willing to play into the role that the mainstream press has assigned to gay people, which is as servants of straight ideals."[24]<br>

                    RuPaul has been an active supporter of voter registration, producing a public service announcement supporting National Voter Registration Day[63] and urging everyone to register.[64] As RuPaul said voter ID laws vary from state to state; the details of the voter ID required in each 
                    state are provided by HeadCount and VoteRiders. As one in five LGBTQ adults are not registered to vote, voter registration efforts have expanded recently. Several stars from RuPaul's Drag Race act as Ambassadors for Drag Out the Vote.[65]<br>
                    <br>
                    Main article: Tennessee Adult Entertainment Act<br>
                    <br>
                    In March 2023, in response to the Tennessee Adult Entertainment Act, RuPaul, World of Wonder producers Randy Barbarto and Fenton Bailey, and MTV began a fund to fight anti-drag initiatives.[66][67][68] The ACLU maintains the fund,[69] which received donations from efforts at 
                    DragCon LA 2023,[70] the "Drag Isn't Dangerous" livestream telethon,[71] "Can't Hold us Down",[72] "Born This Way",[73] and "God Save the Queens",[74] as well as a small donation from the Manhattan Association of Cabarets.[75]<br>
                    <br>
                    The Instagram post RuPaul made prior to the establishment of the fund called on followers to vote, saying, "Register to vote so we can get those stunt queens out of office." The video ends with the statement, "By the way, a social media post has never been as powerful as a registered vote."[76]<br>

                    RuPaul has been the subject of multiple controversies regarding his comments and actions towards the transgender community. According to Vox, he has a complicated relationship with this community, in part due to differing philosophies: through drag he seeks to mock gender and identity stereotypes, 
                    while in his view the trans community takes identity seriously.[83] Nevertheless, RuPaul's Drag Race has featured a number of contestants who are trans women, some of whom made their identity public while competing on the show, including Sonique, Carmen Carrera, Jiggly Caliente, Monica Beverly Hillz, 
                    Kenya Michaels, and Gia Gunn.[84][85] Later seasons of the show have included contestants who had already disclosed their trans identity prior to their season beginning. In 2017, Peppermint became the first contestant to compete throughout her season as an openly trans woman and in 2021 Gottmik was 
                    the first to compete as an openly trans man.[86][87] Other non-conforming gender identities expressed by former contestants include both non-binary (Jinkx Monsoon, Aja, Valentina, Divina de Campo, Ginny Lemon, Violet Chachki,[88] and Sasha Velour[89]) and genderfluid (Courtney Act[90] and Kelly Mantle[91]) persons.<br>
                    <br>
                    In 2014, trans activists and former contestants Carmen Carrera and Monica Beverly Hillz criticized the show's use of words such as tranny and shemale, including the main challenge announcement phrase up to season 6, "You've got she-mail", which they described as transphobic.[92][93] That year's season also included a 
                    "Female or She-male" segment that required contestants to guess whether various photographs featured cisgender "biological women" or "psychological women" (drag queens), causing further criticism.[94] RuPaul and the producers issued a statement promising "to help spread love, acceptance and understanding" and Logo TV removed the 
                    "You've got she-mail" phrase from subsequent broadcasts, replacing it instead with the phrase "She done already done had herses."[95] RuPaul criticized those attempting to police his language in bad faith and noted that tranny referred to transvestites and drag queens, not just trans women.[96][97]<br>
                    <br>
                    In 2018, RuPaul gave an interview to The Guardian in which he stated that a post-transition trans woman would "probably not" be accepted onto the show, noting that at the time of competition Peppermint had not yet had breast implants.[98] After facing criticism on social media and from former contestants for his remarks,[99] 
                    RuPaul compared trans drag queens who had transitioned to athletes who had taken performance-enhancing drugs.[100] He subsequently expressed regret for the hurt caused by his remarks, and that the only screening criteria for contestants were "charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and talent."[101] Since he made these statements, 
                    multiple transgender contestants have competed on the show.<br>

                    RuPaul met painter Georges LeBar in 1994 at the Limelight nightclub in New York City.[102] They married in January 2017.[103] They have an open marriage; RuPaul has said he would not want to "put restraints" on the person he loves.[104] The two split their time between a home in Los Angeles and a 60,000-acre (24,000 ha) 
                    ranch in Wyoming.[105] Environmentalists criticized them in 2020 after RuPaul revealed that they lease mineral rights and sell water to oil companies on their ranch, and allow fracking there.[106][107][108] According to public maps, the ranch has at least 35 active wells.[109] RuPaul previously held a climate-themed ball 
                    on his show to raise environmental awareness, leading to accusations of hypocrisy.[110]
                    <br>
                    RuPaul publicly endorsed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.[111] He expressed dismay at Clinton's defeat by Republican nominee Donald Trump, saying, "The America that we have all fought so hard for, the narrative of love and peace and liberty and equality, 
                    it feels like it is dead."[112] He has described doing drag as a "very, very political" act because it "challenges the status quo" by rejecting fixed identities: "Drag says 'I'm a shapeshifter, I do whatever the hell I want at any given time'."[113]<br>
                    <br>
                    RuPaul started smoking cannabis at age 10 or 11.[114][115][116] Since 1999, he has been sober and has not had alcohol, drugs, or tobacco. In 2020, he found out while appearing on the TV show Finding Your Roots that he and New Jersey Senator Cory Booker are cousins.[117] In a 2013 interview, RuPaul said,
                     "I'm not religious, but I do have spiritual practices like yoga and meditation and I do pray."[118]<br>
