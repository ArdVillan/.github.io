        <li>Error 2: html language (<html language="en">) not stated at beginning of code, instead it was in the head of the code. I fixed this by adding it right after stating the doc type, 
        and took it out of the header. </li>
        <li>Error 3: I changed language to lang </li>

        <li>Error 12: Line 31 has a clickable link but uses an ending image tag instead of an a tag, so i changed the end tag to </a> </li>
